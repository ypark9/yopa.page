In this article, we will walk through the process of invoking an AWS API Gateway using Signature Version 4 (SigV4) for authentication in TypeScript. 

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You will also need an AWS account with access to API Gateway and the necessary permissions to invoke APIs.

## Step 1: Install the Necessary Libraries

We'll need the `aws-sdk` and `aws4` libraries. You can install them with npm:

```bash
npm install aws-sdk aws4 @types/aws4
```

## Step 2: Import the Libraries and Configure AWS

```typescript
import * as AWS from 'aws-sdk';
import * as aws4 from 'aws4';
import * as https from 'https';

AWS.config.update({
  region: 'us-west-2', // replace with your desired region
  accessKeyId: 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY', // replace with your access key
  secretAccessKey: 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY' // replace with your secret key
});
```

## Step 3: Create a Request Object and Sign It

```typescript
let request: aws4.Request = {
  host: 'API_ID.execute-api.REGION.amazonaws.com', // replace with your API Gateway URL
  method: 'GET', // replace with your HTTP method
  path: '/Prod/path', // replace with your API path
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
};

request = aws4.sign(request);
```

<details>
<summary>WHAT is **API path** ? </summary>

  The `path` in the request object refers to the specific endpoint in your API Gateway that you want to invoke. This is usually mapped to a specific function in your backend service. If you're using AWS Lambda as your backend service, each path in your API Gateway would typically be mapped to a specific Lambda function.

  For example, let's say you have an API for managing users, and you have the following Lambda functions:

  - `CreateUserFunction`: Creates a new user.
  - `GetUserFunction`: Gets the details of a user.
  - `UpdateUserFunction`: Updates a user's details.
  - `DeleteUserFunction`: Deletes a user.

  You might set up your API Gateway with the following paths:

  - `POST /users`: Invokes `CreateUserFunction`.
  - `GET /users/{userId}`: Invokes `GetUserFunction`.
  - `PUT /users/{userId}`: Invokes `UpdateUserFunction`.
  - `DELETE /users/{userId}`: Invokes `DeleteUserFunction`.

  In this case, if you wanted to get the details of a user with the ID `123`, you would set the `path` in your request object to `/users/123`, and the `method` to `GET`.

  So, in the context of the code example, `/Prod/path` is a placeholder for the path you want to invoke in your API Gateway. You would replace this with the actual path for your API. For example, if you're invoking the `GetUserFunction` in the example above, you might set the `path` to `/users/123`.

  Here's how you might modify the request object for this example:

  ```typescript
  let request: aws4.Request = {
    host: 'API_ID.execute-api.REGION.amazonaws.com', // replace with your API Gateway URL
    method: 'GET', // replace with your HTTP method
    path: '/users/123', // replace with your API path
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
  };
  ```

  Remember to replace `API_ID`, `REGION`, and the path with your actual values.

## Step 4: Send the Request

```typescript
const req = https.request(request, (res) => {
  let body = '';
  res.on('data', (chunk) => body += chunk);
  res.on('end', () => console.log(body));
});

req.on('error', (e) => console.error(e));
req.end();
```

This will send a SigV4 signed request to your API Gateway. Remember to replace the placeholders with your actual values.

Please note that this is a basic example and you may need to adjust it according to your needs. For example, if you are sending a POST request, you would need to include the body in the request and sign it as well.
