When working with TypeScript, it's often necessary to determine the type of a variable. In particular, you might need to check whether a variable is of object type. Fortunately, TypeScript provides a straightforward way to perform this type check.

## The `typeof` Operator

In TypeScript, you can use the `typeof` operator to check the type of a variable. To determine if a variable is of object type, combine `typeof` with the `object` keyword.

Here's an example:

```typescript
const variable: any = {}; // Your variable

if (typeof variable === 'object' && variable !== null) {
  console.log('The variable is an object.');
} else {
  console.log('The variable is not an object.');
}
```

In this code snippet, the `typeof variable === 'object'` condition checks whether the type of `variable` is an object. Additionally, `variable !== null` ensures that `null` is not considered an object.

## Specifying a Specific Object Type

If you're looking to check for a specific object type, you can replace the `any` type in the variable declaration with the desired type.

Here's an example:

```typescript
const variable: SomeObjectType = {}; // Your variable of type SomeObjectType

if (typeof variable === 'object' && variable !== null) {
  console.log('The variable is an object of type SomeObjectType.');
} else {
  console.log('The variable is not an object of type SomeObjectType.');
}
```

Replace `SomeObjectType` with the actual type you're expecting for your variable.

## Conclusion

Checking the object type in TypeScript is essential when you want to ensure the correctness of your code. By using the `typeof` operator in combination with the `object` keyword, you can easily determine whether a variable is an object. If you're looking for a specific object type, replace the `any` type with the desired type in the variable declaration.
