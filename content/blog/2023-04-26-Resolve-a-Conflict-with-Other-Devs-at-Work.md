So, you've found yourself in a bit of a pickle with another developer at work. Maybe they disagree with your coding style, or they think your approach to a project is all wrong. Whatever the reason, you're not seeing eye-to-eye and it's starting to affect your working relationship. Here is my two cents.

## Step 1: Take a Deep Breath

First things first, take a deep breath and remember that you're both on the same team. It's not you against them, it's both of you working towards the same goal. This conflict is just a bump in the road and it will pass. So, relax and try to approach the situation with an open mind.

## Step 2: Listen

Now that you're feeling a bit more zen, it's time to hear them out. Really listen to what they have to say and try to understand where they're coming from. Maybe they have some valid points that you haven't considered. Or maybe they just need to vent a little. Either way, let them have their say and don't interrupt.

## Step 3: State Your Case

Once they've had their turn, it's time for you to state your case. Explain why you've made the decisions you have and why you think they're the right ones. Be prepared to provide evidence to back up your claims. This isn't a courtroom, but it doesn't hurt to have some facts on your side.

## Step 4: Compromise

Now that you've both had your say, it's time to find some common ground. Is there a way to combine your ideas? Can you meet in the middle somewhere? Maybe you can agree to try things their way for a little while and see how it goes. The important thing is to find a solution that works for both of you.

## Step 5: Fist Bump

Congratulations! You've successfully resolved a conflict with another dev. Now it's time to seal the deal with a handshake (or a fist bump if that's more your style). Remember, you're both on the same team and you're both working towards the same goal. So, put this conflict behind you and get back to coding like the superstars you are.

I believe, avoiding conflicts is not always the best approach, but neither is facing them in a destructive way. It's important to find a balance and approach conflicts with an open mind, a willingness to listen and understand, and a commitment to finding a mutually beneficial solution.

Cheers! 🍺
