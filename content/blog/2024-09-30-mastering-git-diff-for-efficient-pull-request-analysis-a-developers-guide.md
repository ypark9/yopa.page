# Mastering Git Diff for Efficient Pull Request Analysis: A Developer's Guide

As a developer, reviewing pull requests is a crucial part of the software development process. While platforms like GitHub and GitLab offer user-friendly interfaces for this task, sometimes we need a more tailored approach. This guide will show you how to leverage the power of `git diff` to analyze pull requests effectively and efficiently.

## Understanding the Basics of Git Diff

Before diving into advanced techniques, let's cover the fundamental `git diff` commands for pull request analysis:

1. Ensure you're on the target branch (usually main):

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

1. Fetch the latest changes:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

1. View changes between the current branch and the pull request branch:

   ```bash
   git diff main..origin/feature-branch
   ```

   1. e.g. `origin/release` is the target branch, and `story/DX-16597` is the pull request branch.

      ```bash
      git diff origin/release..origin/story/DX-16597
      ```

1. For a concise summary of changes:

   ```bash
   git diff --stat main..origin/feature-branch
   ```

1. To see only changed file names:
   ```bash
   git diff --name-status main..origin/feature-branch
   ```

These commands provide a solid foundation for pull request analysis, but they often include more information than necessary.

## Advanced Git Diff Techniques for Focused Analysis

To overcome the limitations of standard `git diff` output, which often includes irrelevant files like `CHANGELOG.md` or `package-lock.json`, we can use a more refined approach:

```bash
git fetch origin
git diff origin/main..origin/feature-branch \
  --unified=0 \
  ':!CHANGELOG.md' \
  ':!package-lock.json' \
  ':!yarn.lock' \
  ':!*.lock' \
  ':!*.md' \
  > pr_changes.txt
```

This command:

1. Fetches the latest changes
2. Compares the main branch to the feature branch
3. Shows only changed lines without context
4. Excludes specific files and file types
5. Outputs the result to a file

> Warning: if PR does not contain the certain file types, you may need to remove the exclusion patterns or you get an error like `fatal: :!yarn.lock: no such path in the working tree.`. You need to remove `':!yarn.lock'` from the command.

## Customizing Your Git Diff Approach

The beauty of this method lies in its flexibility. You can easily modify the exclusion patterns to suit your project's needs. For example, to exclude all JSON files, add `:!*.json` to the list.

## Implementing the Advanced Git Diff Technique

After running the advanced command, you'll have a `pr_changes.txt` file containing a focused diff of your pull request. You can:

1. Review the changes directly in this file
2. Share the file with team members for collaborative review
3. Use the content with AI tools for automated analysis without context limit concerns

For a quick overview, use:

```bash
head -n 50 pr_changes.txt
```

This displays the first 50 lines of the diff, giving you a snapshot of the changes.

## Conclusion

By mastering these advanced `git diff` techniques, I see a significant improvement in my pull request analysis process. I can focus on the relevant code changes, ignore unnecessary files, and collaborate more effectively with my team. I hope this guide helps you streamline your pull request reviews and enhances your overall development workflow.
