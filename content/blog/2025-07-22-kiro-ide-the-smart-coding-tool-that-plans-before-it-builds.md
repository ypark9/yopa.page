## What Makes Kiro IDE Different?

Kiro IDE is Amazon‚Äôs new AI coding assistant that helps you plan before you code. Unlike other tools that just write code quickly, Kiro focuses on creating clear plans and requirements first.

Kiro IDE launched on July 14, 2025. It‚Äôs different from other coding tools because it makes you plan your project before writing any code. Think of it like building a house: most AI tools start building right away, but Kiro wants you to draw up blueprints first.

This method follows Amazon‚Äôs own way of building software‚Äîalways planning before coding. Now, anyone can use this approach with Kiro IDE.

## Two Ways to Work: Vibe Mode vs Spec Mode

Kiro gives you two different ways to work:

**Vibe Mode** - Ask questions, get code samples, or fix bugs through chat. It‚Äôs good for learning or trying new ideas.

**Spec Mode** - Kiro asks you detailed questions about your project before writing any code. Example questions:

- What exactly do you want to build?
- Who will use it?
- What could go wrong?
- How should it handle errors?

After you answer, it makes a full plan and then writes the code.

## Real Example: Building a Review System

Let's say you want to add reviews to your product website. Here's how each mode works:

**In Vibe Mode:**

- You: "Add reviews to products"
- Kiro: _immediately creates React components for reviews_

**In Spec Mode:**

- You: "Add reviews to products"
- Kiro: "Let me understand this better. Should users be able to rate with stars? Edit their reviews? What happens with spam reviews?"
- After you discuss these details, Kiro creates a complete plan with database designs, user stories, and security considerations
- Only then does it write the actual code

## The Magic Behind the Scenes

Kiro uses several AI agents:

- Planning agents decide what needs to be built.
- Code agents write the code.
- Quality agents check for good practices.
- Integration agents make sure everything works together.

Kiro is powered by Claude Sonnet 4.0, a strong AI model that handles complex projects well. (also you can use Claude 3.5 Sonnet)

## Key Features That Make Developers Happy

**Smart Project Organization:** Keeps all your plans and documents organized in a special folder, `.kiro`.

**Task Management:** Breaks work into small tasks you can approve.

**AWS Integration:** Works with AWS‚Äîturn hand-drawn diagrams into real cloud code.

**Automatic Documentation:** Updates documentation automatically.

**Background Helpers:** Runs tests and checks code quality in the background.

## Developers have mixed opinions:

- Enterprise developers like it‚Äîthey built complex systems quickly with full documentation and security. (I'm one of them)
- Startup developers are split. Some like the planning, others find it slow for quick experiments.
- Common complaints: repeats suggestions, can be too generic, uses lots of computer power, and sometimes slows down.

## Compared to other AI Coding Tools (purely my opinion)

- Cursor: Fast code writing and debugging, but messy for big projects.
- GitHub Copilot: Great for code completion, but focuses on speed, not planning.
- Windsurf: Used to be popular but lost users after business problems.
- Kiro: The only tool that requires planning and creates organized code.

## Current limits:

**Language Support:** Best with TypeScript, Python, and Java. Other languages work but not as well.

**Learning Curve:** Takes time to learn the planning approach but this is where it shines.

**Performance Issues:** Can be slow or limited during busy times.

**Setup Challenges:** Can get confused by complex development environments or unusual configurations.

**.NET Problems:** Doesn't work well for C# developers due to missing Microsoft tools. (I'm not a C# developer so take this with a grain of salt)

## Pricing and Availability

Right now, Kiro is free during the public preview, but there are daily limits on how much you can use it.

Amazon originally announced these prices:

- Free: 50 interactions per month
- Pro ($19/month): 1,000 interactions
- Pro+ ($39/month): 3,000 interactions

But they removed these details due to user confusion about what counts as an "interaction." New pricing should be announced soon.

The good news: you don't need an AWS account to use Kiro. You can sign in with Google, GitHub, or AWS credentials.

## Should You Try Kiro IDE?

**Kiro is perfect if you:**

- Work on complex, long-term projects
- Want to write maintainable code from the start
- Like having detailed documentation
- Work in a team that values planning (I am in this category)
- Build enterprise or production systems

**Stick with other tools if you:**

- Do lots of experimental coding
- Need to prototype very quickly (go with Cursor)
- Work mostly alone on small projects
- Prefer maximum flexibility over structure

## Wrapping it up üëè

I believe Kiro is best for people working on complex, long-term projects, teams that care about planning, or anyone who wants maintainable code from the start. If you need to build quick prototypes or work alone on small projects, other tools may be faster (hmmm. Cursor).

Kiro changes how we use AI for coding. Instead of just speeding up code writing, it helps you design better systems. This could become the new standard for building reliable software.

Kiro is still in preview, but its focus on planning and maintainability makes it stand out. As Amazon improves it, Kiro could become a must-have for professional developers. At least I love to see the new direction of AI coding tools in the market.

Cheers! üç∫
