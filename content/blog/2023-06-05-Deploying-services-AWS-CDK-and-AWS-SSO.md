AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is a powerful tool that allows developers to define infrastructure resources using familiar programming languages. It provides a higher-level abstraction to provision and manage AWS resources, making it easier to deploy and maintain complex architectures.

In this article, we will explore how to use AWS CDK along with AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) to deploy services such as API Gateway, Lambda functions, Lambda layers, and S3 buckets. We'll walk through a real-life example to illustrate the process.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- An AWS account with sufficient permissions to create and manage resources.
- AWS CDK and AWS CLI installed and configured on your local machine.
- AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) set up with the appropriate users, groups, and permissions.

## Real-Life Example: Deploying API Gateway, Lambda, Lambda Layer, and S3

Let's consider a scenario where you want to create an API Gateway that invokes a Lambda function using a Lambda layer for shared code. The Lambda function should read data from an S3 bucket and return a response.

### Step 1: Set Up the Project

First, create a new directory for your CDK project and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir my-cdk-project
cd my-cdk-project
```

Initialize a new CDK project:

```bash
cdk init --language typescript
```

### Step 2: Install Required Dependencies

Next, install the necessary dependencies for our project:

```bash
npm install aws-cdk-lib @aws-cdk/aws-apigateway @aws-cdk/aws-lambda @aws-cdk/aws-lambda-layer-awscli @aws-cdk/aws-s3 @aws-cdk/aws-ssm
```

### Step 3: Define the CDK Stack

Create a new file called `MyStack.ts` and add the following code:

```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as apigateway from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-apigateway';
import * as lambda from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda';
import * as s3 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3';

export class MyStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // Create an S3 bucket
    const bucket = new s3.Bucket(this, 'MyBucket');

    // Create a Lambda layer from local code
    const layer = new lambda.LayerVersion(this, 'MyLayer', {
      code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('path/to/layer/code'),
      compatibleRuntimes: [lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_14_X],
    });

    // Create a Lambda function
    const fn = new lambda.Function(this, 'MyFunction', {
      runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_14_X,
      handler: 'index.handler',
      code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('path/to/function/code'),
      layers: [layer],
      environment: {
        BUCKET_NAME: bucket.bucketName,
      },
    });

    // Grant read permissions to the Lambda function
    bucket.grantRead(fn);

    // Create an API Gateway REST API
    const api = new apigateway.RestApi(this, 'MyAPI');

    // Create an integration between API Gateway and Lambda


    const integration = new apigateway.LambdaIntegration(fn);

    // Create a resource and add the integration to a default method
    api.root.addMethod('GET', integration);
  }
}
```

Make sure to replace `'path/to/layer/code'` and `'path/to/function/code'` with the actual paths to your Lambda layer and function code.

<details>
  <summary>Explain the code</summary>

The code you provided is an example of a CDK stack that deploys various AWS resources using AWS CDK constructs. Let's go through the code and explain what each part does:

```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as apigateway from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-apigateway';
import * as lambda from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda';
import * as s3 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3';
```

These import statements bring in the necessary CDK constructs from the `aws-cdk-lib` library for creating the AWS resources. In this case, we are importing constructs for API Gateway, Lambda, and S3.

```typescript
export class MyStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);
```

This code defines a new class `MyStack` that extends `cdk.Stack`, which is a core construct in the CDK representing a stack. The constructor function is called when creating an instance of this class, and it takes parameters `scope`, `id`, and `props`.

```typescript
// Create an S3 bucket
const bucket = new s3.Bucket(this, 'MyBucket');
```

This creates a new S3 bucket named 'MyBucket' using the `s3.Bucket` construct. The `this` keyword refers to the current stack instance.

```typescript
// Create a Lambda layer from local code
const layer = new lambda.LayerVersion(this, 'MyLayer', {
  code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('path/to/layer/code'),
  compatibleRuntimes: [lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_14_X],
});
```

This creates a Lambda layer named 'MyLayer' using the `lambda.LayerVersion` construct. The layer is created from local code specified by the `code` property. The `compatibleRuntimes` property specifies the runtime compatibility, in this case, Node.js 14.x.

```typescript
// Create a Lambda function
const fn = new lambda.Function(this, 'MyFunction', {
  runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_14_X,
  handler: 'index.handler',
  code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('path/to/function/code'),
  layers: [layer],
  environment: {
    BUCKET_NAME: bucket.bucketName,
  },
});
```

This creates a Lambda function named 'MyFunction' using the `lambda.Function` construct. The function is associated with the Node.js 14.x runtime and the specified `handler` function. The function code is taken from the local directory specified by the `code` property. The `layers` property specifies that the previously created layer should be included in the function. The `environment` property sets an environment variable `BUCKET_NAME` with the value of the S3 bucket's name.

```typescript
// Grant read permissions to the Lambda function
bucket.grantRead(fn);
```

This grants read permissions to the Lambda function on the S3 bucket, allowing it to access objects in the bucket.

```typescript
// Create an API Gateway REST API
const api = new apigateway.RestApi(this, 'MyAPI');
```

This creates a new API Gateway REST API using the `apigateway.RestApi` construct. The API is associated with the current stack and named 'MyAPI'.

```typescript
// Create an integration between API Gateway and Lambda
const integration = new apigateway.LambdaIntegration(fn);
```

This creates an integration between the API Gateway and the previously created Lambda function using the `apigateway.LambdaIntegration` construct. It specifies that the Lambda function `fn` should be invoked when the API Gateway receives

 requests.

```typescript
// Create a resource and add the integration to a default method
api.root.addMethod('GET', integration);
```

This creates a new resource at the root of the API Gateway and adds a default GET method to it. The method is integrated with the Lambda function `fn`, meaning that when a GET request is made to the API, it will invoke the Lambda function.

When using AWS CDK, IAM policies are automatically assigned based on the resources created and the permissions needed by those resources. For example:

- When creating an S3 bucket using the `s3.Bucket` construct, the CDK automatically assigns the necessary permissions to the IAM role associated with the Lambda function. In this case, the `bucket.grantRead(fn)` line grants read permissions to the Lambda function `fn`, allowing it to access objects in the bucket.

- Similarly, when creating an API Gateway REST API using the `apigateway.RestApi` construct, the CDK assigns the required IAM policies to allow the API Gateway to invoke the associated Lambda function. The integration created between the API Gateway and Lambda function handles the necessary permissions behind the scenes.

CDK simplifies the process of managing IAM policies by inferring the required permissions based on the resource dependencies and configuration. It automatically generates the IAM policies needed for the resources in the CDK stack, ensuring that the appropriate access is granted and minimizing the manual IAM policy management required.

### Step 4: Deploy the Stack

Now, it's time to deploy our stack to AWS. Ensure you are logged in with the appropriate AWS SSO profile by running:

```bash
aws configure sso --profile <your-profile-name>
```

Then, build and deploy the CDK stack:

```bash
cdk deploy --profile <your-profile-name>
```

The CDK will create the necessary resources in your AWS account, including the API Gateway, Lambda function, Lambda layer, and S3 bucket.

### Step 5: Test the API

Once the deployment is complete, you can find the API Gateway URL in the CDK stack output. Use a tool like cURL or Postman to send a GET request to the API and retrieve the response.

Nice! You have successfully deployed services using AWS CDK and AWS SSO.

## Wrapping up!

AWS CDK simplifies the process of provisioning and managing infrastructure resources on AWS. By combining it with AWS SSO, developers can securely deploy services and manage permissions using a single sign-on mechanism. In this article, we explored a real-life example of deploying API Gateway, Lambda functions, Lambda layers, and S3 buckets. This powerful combination allows for efficient and scalable development in the AWS ecosystem.
