# System Patterns

## Architecture

- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: The website is a static site generated by Hugo. This provides excellent performance, security, and simplicity.
- **Content as Code**: Blog posts and pages are written in Markdown and stored in the git repository.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: The AWS infrastructure is managed using Terraform, ensuring it is versioned and reproducible.

## Design Patterns

- **Theme-based UI**: The UI is based on the `hugo-tania` theme, which provides a consistent look and feel.
- **Modular Terraform**: Terraform code is organized into modules for reusability and maintainability.
