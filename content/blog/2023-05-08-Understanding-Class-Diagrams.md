Class diagrams (a type of UML diagram) are a key tool used in object-oriented programming to visualize the relationships between classes. These diagrams help developers to understand the structure of their code and how different classes interact with one another. One important aspect of class diagrams is the use of UML arrows to show relationships between classes.

## Types of UML Arrows in Class Diagrams
There are several types of arrows that can be used in class diagrams to show different types of relationships between classes. Here are some of the most common ones:

1. Association Arrows
Association arrows are used to show that two classes are associated with one another in some way. For example, a Student class might be associated with a Course class if the student is enrolled in that course. Association arrows are typically drawn as a straight line with an arrowhead pointing from one class to another.
