Class diagrams (a type of UML diagram) are a key tool used in object-oriented programming to visualize the relationships between classes. These diagrams help developers to understand the structure of their code and how different classes interact with one another. One important aspect of class diagrams is the use of UML arrows to show relationships between classes.

## Types of UML Arrows in Class Diagrams

There are several types of arrows that can be used in class diagrams to show different types of relationships between classes. Here are some of the most common ones:

1. Association Arrows
   Association arrows are used to show that two classes are associated with one another in some way. For example, a Student class might be associated with a Course class if the student is enrolled in that course. Association arrows are typically drawn as a straight line with an arrowhead pointing from one class to another.

```
   +-----------+          +-----------+
   |   Course  | -------->|  Student  |
   +-----------+          +-----------+
```

In this example, the Course class is associated with the Student class, indicating that a student can enroll in one or more courses.

2. Aggregation Arrows
   Aggregation arrows are used to show that one class is a part of another class. For example, a `Car` class might have an aggregation relationship with a `Wheel` class, indicating that a car is made up of one or more wheels. Aggregation arrows are typically drawn as a straight line with an arrowhead pointing from the part class to the whole class, and a diamond shape on the whole class side.

```
   +-----------+          +-----------+
   |     Car   |          |   Wheel   |
   +-----------+          +-----------+
         ‚óá                       ‚óá
         |                       |
     +-------+               +-------+
     | Wheel |               | Wheel |
     +-------+               +-------+
```

In this example, the Car class has an aggregation relationship with the Wheel class, indicating that a car is made up of one or more wheels.

3. Composition Arrows
   Composition arrows are similar to aggregation arrows, but they indicate a stronger relationship between classes. In a composition relationship, the part class is completely contained within the whole class, and cannot exist independently. For example, a `House` class might have a composition relationship with a `Room` class, indicating that a room cannot exist outside of a house. Composition arrows are typically drawn with a filled diamond shape on the whole class side.

```
   +-----------+          +-----------+
   |    House  |          |    Room   |
   +-----------+          +-----------+
         ‚óÜ                       ‚óÜ
         |                       |
     +-------+               +-------+
     | Room  |               | Room  |
     +-------+               +-------+

```

In this example, the `House` class has a composition relationship with the `Room` class, indicating that a room cannot exist outside of a house.

4. Inheritance Arrows
   Inheritance arrows are used to show that one class inherits properties and methods from another class. For example, a `Dog` class might inherit from an `Animal` class, indicating that a dog is a type of animal. Inheritance arrows are typically drawn as a straight line with an arrowhead pointing from the subclass to the superclass, and a solid triangle on the superclass side.

```
   +-----------+         +-----------+
   |   Animal  |‚óÅ--------|     Dog   |
   +-----------+         +-----------+
```

In this example, the `Dog` class inherits from the `Animal` class, indicating that a dog is a type of animal.

## NOW Challenge! Draw Dependency Injection!!

```
   +----------------------+                    +-----------------+
   |  Service Interfeace  |<------------------ |  Service Impl   |
   +----------------------+    implements      +-----------------+
              ^                                         |
              |  depends on                             |
              |                                         |
   +----------------------+         is provided         |
   |      Component       |<-----------------------------
   +----------------------+
```

In this diagram, `Component` depends on the `ServiceInterface`. `ServiceImpl` implements the `ServiceInterface`, and an instance of `ServiceImpl` is provided to `Component`. This is an example of dependency injection, where `Component` does not create an instance of `ServiceImpl` itself, but rather receives it from an external source (e.g., a dependency injection framework or a constructor parameter).
