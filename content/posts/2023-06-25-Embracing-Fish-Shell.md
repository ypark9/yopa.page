The command-line interface (CLI) remains an integral tool in every developer's toolkit. It allows developers to interact with the operating system and perform tasks such as file manipulation, process control, and even software development. Bash has long been the default shell for most Linux distributions and macOS. However, there is an alternative gaining popularity - the Friendly Interactive Shell, also known as Fish.

Fish is a modern and user-friendly command-line shell designed to provide a rich scripting environment, out-of-the-box intelligent features, and a visually appealing interface. Here are some reasons why developers are embracing Fish shell as their new command-line partner.

## **1. Intelligent Autocompletion**

One of Fish's most praised features is its intelligent and robust autocomplete functionality. Unlike Bash, Fish can suggest commands based on the user's history and often-used commands. Fish even completes commands based on man page entries, making it easier to use and learn new commands.

## **2. Syntax Highlighting**

Fish shell provides syntax highlighting right on the command line, an uncommon feature for shells. Incorrect commands are highlighted in red, making it easier to spot mistakes. Valid file paths, on the other hand, are highlighted in a different color, providing quick visual feedback.

## **3. Web-Based Configuration**

Fish includes a web-based configuration system, known as Fish Config. This allows for a graphical user interface to change shell appearance, variables, and functions without the need for text-based configuration files.

## **4. Improved Scripting**

Fish offers a more straightforward scripting syntax than other shells like Bash. Its syntax is designed to be simpler and more consistent, reducing the complexity involved in writing shell scripts.

## **5. Excellent Documentation**

Fish boasts an extensive and well-structured documentation, accessible directly through the command line with the `help` command. This makes learning Fish and troubleshooting issues a breeze.

## **6. Event Handling**

Fish supports event handling mechanism that triggers functions on shell events, such as variable changes or process exits. This allows developers to automate certain tasks in response to specific events.

## **7. Extensive Customizability**

Fish allows developers to customize the prompt, color scheme, and even the shell's behavior, thanks to its powerful and straightforward scripting capabilities.

In conclusion, Fish shell offers a modern, intelligent, and user-friendly alternative to traditional shells. Its rich features, coupled with a focus on usability and consistency, make it a game-changing tool for developers. Whether you're a seasoned developer looking for a more productive shell or a novice seeking a friendly introduction to the command line, Fish shell is worth considering.

Give it a try, and you might find your command-line experience transformed.
