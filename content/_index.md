Greetings! Welcome to my blog, your guiding beacon through the stormy waters of tech jargon. Here, I share my personal adventures and misadventures, offering wisdom to help you steer clear of the pitfalls. There have been moments when I found myself in rough seas, mentally shouting "that's a no-no!" Thus, the name of this blog was born: "thats.nono." Join me as we navigate these choppy waters together.
