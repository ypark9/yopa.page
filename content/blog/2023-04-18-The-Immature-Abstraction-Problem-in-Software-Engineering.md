One of the most common and often overlooked issues is the immature abstraction problem, which occurs when code gets too cocky for its own good.

At its core, the immature abstraction problem stems from a lack of understanding of how to properly abstract code. Inexperienced developers often create abstractions that are too complex or too generic, resulting in code that is difficult to understand and maintain. And let's face it, we've all been there at some point - trying to show off our skills by making our code look as abstract and clever as possible.

But as any seasoned developer knows, abstracting code is not just about making it look pretty or impressive. It's about creating code that is both efficient and easy to read and maintain. Unfortunately, when developers get too caught up in the abstraction process, they can lose sight of these goals and end up with code that is confusing, overly complex, and prone to bugs.

what's the solution to the immature abstraction problem? The answer is simple - don't get too cocky with your code! Remember that the goal of abstraction is to make your code easier to read and maintain, not to show off how clever you can be.

If you're unsure whether your abstraction is mature or immature, ask yourself these questions:

- Is this abstraction necessary or just a fancy way of doing things?
- Will this abstraction make my code easier to read and maintain?
- Is this abstraction understandable to someone who is not familiar with the language or framework?

If you can't answer these questions confidently, it might be time to rethink your abstraction.
