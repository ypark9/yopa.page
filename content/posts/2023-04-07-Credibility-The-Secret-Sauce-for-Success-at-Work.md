So, I decided to hit the reset button on my career and start from scratch. Was it worth it? Honestly, I'm still figuring it out. But one thing's for sure, if I had these things done on my first career path, things would've turned out way differently.

Let's dive in.

## Do More Than Just Meet Expectations

Sure, completing assigned tasks and meeting deadlines is important, but that's just the bare minimum. To build credibility, __you need to go above and beyond what's expected__. Identify unmet needs and do work without being asked. It's like being the superhero of the office, swooping in to save the day and impressing everyone with your proactive attitude.

## Don't Be A One-Trick Pony

Being inflexible and __saying "it's not my job" is like shooting yourself in the foot.__ You're limiting your growth and opportunities by only accepting certain kinds of work. Instead, be open to taking on tasks outside of your job profile. It's like being a jack-of-all-trades and a master of credibility.

## Plan Like A Pro

Proactively identifying problems and creating a plan to address them is like having a superpower. Instead of reacting to problems as they arise, __use the premortem technique to visualize what might go wrong and create a plan to solve those issues.__ It's like being a master strategist and a hero of problem-solving.

## Be The Solution, Not The Problem

Don't be the Debbie Downer who only points out problems. __Be the solutionist who comes prepared with ideas and solutions.__ It's like being a superhero who always saves the day and impresses everyone with their problem-solving skills.

## Be The Team Player

Prioritizing the team over personal interests is like being the MVP of the office. Employees who do work that matters to the organization and contribute to the team's success build credibility while also contributing to their own learning and growth. It's like being a team player and a superhero at the same time.

## Share Your Superpowers

Sharing knowledge is like spreading your superpowers around the office. Instead of withholding knowledge, share it with others and help them grow. By doing so, you become a valued resource to your colleagues, managers, and stakeholders. It's like being a mentor and a superhero all in one.

## Adapt To The Future

Being willing to change and adapt to future needs is like being a superhero who's always ready for the next challenge. Instead of sticking to old methods, __expand your comfort zone and develop new skills.__ It's like being a chameleon and a superhero at the same time.

## Respect The Clock

Showing up on time is like being a superhero who's always punctual and respectful of others' time. Don't be the one who's always late and keeps others waiting. __Respect the clock and build some credibility.__

May your career be bug-free.
Cheer! üç∫
