# Task: Add "Copy content for AI" Button

**Status**: Complete ✅
**Priority**: High
**Complexity**: Level 2 - Simple Enhancement

### Description

To enhance the user experience for visitors who use AI coding assistants, a "Copy content for AI" button will be added to each blog post page. When clicked, this button will copy the entire article's raw markdown content to the user's clipboard, making it easy to paste into an AI prompt.

### Requirements

1.  ✅ A "Copy content for AI" button must be present on every blog post page.
2.  ✅ The button's design must be consistent with the `hugo-tania` theme.
3.  ✅ Clicking the button must copy the post's full markdown content to the clipboard.
4.  ✅ The user should receive feedback that the copy action was successful (e.g., button text changes temporarily).

### Implementation Results

#### Files Created/Modified (Using Hugo Theme Overrides)

- ✅ `layouts/_default/single.html`: Override template with button and hidden markdown content
- ✅ `static/js/copyAiButton.js`: JavaScript logic for copy-to-clipboard with fallbacks
- ✅ `static/css/copy-ai-button.css`: Styles matching hugo-tania theme aesthetic
- ✅ `layouts/partials/head/custom.html`: Includes custom CSS and JS files
- ✅ `layouts/_default/_markup/render-image.html`: Image rendering fix for missing images

#### Implementation Verification

- ✅ Site builds successfully without errors
- ✅ Button appears on all blog post pages
- ✅ Hidden div contains raw markdown content (.RawContent)
- ✅ CSS and JavaScript files properly included
- ✅ Hugo development server runs without issues
- ✅ Static files copied to build output

#### Testing Completed

- ✅ Hugo build process (`hugo --destination /tmp/test`)
- ✅ Static file generation verification
- ✅ HTML output verification (button and hidden content present)
- ✅ Development server functionality
- ✅ Template override system working correctly

### Technical Details

The implementation uses Hugo's theme override system, which means:

- No modifications to the original hugo-tania theme repository
- All customizations are contained in the main site directory
- Changes are version-controlled with the site content
- Theme can be updated without losing customizations

The JavaScript includes both modern Clipboard API support and fallback methods for older browsers or non-HTTPS contexts.

**Status: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** ✅
